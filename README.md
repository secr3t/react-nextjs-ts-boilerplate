This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Start React & Nextjs & TS with this boilerplate on Mac

## clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/secr3t/react-nextjs-ts-boilerplate.git <PROJECT_DIR>
```

## first set
move to project dir and run this below.
```bash
rm -rf .git && sed -i '' "s/PROJECT_NAME/$(basename $(pwd))/" package.json
```

## Requirements

### install nodejs
Go to [nodejs homepage](https://nodejs.org/ko/) and get node 18 

### install yarn

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

## Getting Started
First, get packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
